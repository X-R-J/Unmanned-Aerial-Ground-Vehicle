# Unmanned-Aerial-Ground-Vehicle
A multimodal post-disaster rescue drone was designed and fabricated, which is capable of traversing through the interiors of ruins and locating buried injured individuals. The drone possesses multi-modal perception capabilities for the external environment. It is equipped with a depth camera on its body and an annular protective cover on the exterior. The outer layer of the protective cover is equipped with pressure sensors and strain sensors. Additionally, the drone has multi-modal movement capabilities. Its bottom is a four-wheel drive chassis that can switch between flight mode and ground movement mode at any time according to different external environments. Inside the ruins, the drone can use pressure sensors to determine whether the obstructions ahead are soft and passable, assisting the drone in making a better path plan and approaching the injured at a faster speed.
